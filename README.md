# Heart Disease Assessment Model

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a model that assesses the risk of heart disease based on basic patient data. The model will use simple regression techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Data Required
To build and validate our model, the following patient data will be required:
- Age
- Sex 
- Chest_Pain_Type
- Resting_bp_s
- Cholesterol
- Fasting_blood_Sugar
- Resting_ecg
- Max_heart_rate
- Exercise_angina
- Oldpeak
- ST_slope
- target


## Potential Outcome
The primary outcome of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the risk of heart disease. This model will help in early detection and preventive healthcare planning.

## Resources
### Datasets
- [Heart Disease Dataset on IEEEDataPort] (https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/heart-disease-dataset-comprehensive)
  - This heart disease dataset is curated by combining 5 popular heart disease datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes.
- [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
  - This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
- [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
  - The dataset consists of 70 000 records of patients data, 11 features + target.
