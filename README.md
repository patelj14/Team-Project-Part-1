# Heart Disease Assessment Model

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a model that assesses the risk of heart disease based on basic patient data. The model will use simple regression techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Data Required
To build and validate our model, the following patient data will be required:
- Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels

## Potential Outcome
The primary outcome of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the risk of heart disease. This model will help in early detection and preventive healthcare planning.

## Resources
### Datasets
- [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle]
  - This dataset includes patient records with various health metrics and the presence or absence of heart disease. It will be used to train and test our model.
